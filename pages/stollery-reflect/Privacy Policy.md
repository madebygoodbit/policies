_LAST UPDATED: July 18, 2022_

Goodbit Ideas Inc.("Goodbit", “we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our websites located at https://reflect.stollerytomorrowandtoday.com (the “Site”). The Site includes all downloadable applications, features, functionality, content, or information that is made available or provided on the Site and any other media form, media channel, mobile website, or mobile application related or connected thereto. We respect the privacy of our users and to further our mission, we endeavor to provide you with all relevant information prior to collecting your personal information.

This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Use and explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal information when you visit our Site. The Site is made available to you for educational and research purposes.

By voluntarily providing us with personal information through the Site, you are consenting to its collection, use, and disclosure in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You acknowledge and agree that such personal information may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Goodbit and authorized third parties located in Canada and the United States.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the Site. We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last Updated” date of this Privacy Policy. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Privacy Policy on the Site. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Site after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted. Your participation on this platform is voluntary - you can exit the Site at any time.

### **COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION**

Personal information is information that identifies you as an individual. The information we may collect or obtain includes:

- Information you provide to us by contacting us via email. We do not collect your name, address, phone number, email address or such personal information through the Site.

- General usage data: The information our servers automatically collect when you access the Site include your browser type, operating system, access times, and the pages you have viewed on our site. We do not log your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address on our servers. IP addresses may be stored by our security provider for purposes of security protection. If you are using our Site, this information may also include your device type, your device system language, and city location, your operating system, your country, and other interactions with the Site.

- Cookies: In addition, when you visit our Site, we collect certain information about your activity on our Site, as further described below.

The Site is administered by us in Canada; however we may transfer, process, and store any information collected through the Site either in Canada or in the United States. Please note that this may not provide as much protection as your home country.

### **COOKIES AND WEB ANALYTICS**

We use Google Analytics and it drops a cookie to help us track basic game functionality and anonymized usage analytics. A “cookie” is a tiny element of data that our Site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your device. If you are concerned about your privacy and the use of cookie technology, you may set your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. You may also set your browser to refuse the cookies our Site attempts to send you. Please note that if you decide to turn off or block cookies, our Site might not function correctly.

Goodbit does have access to Google Analytics logs, which do not contain your name but do contain information closely associated with you. We use IP address anonymization on our servers and Google Analytics anonymization to avoid storing information that could identify you. We record only non-identifying data about the use (e.g.: what is clicked on, survey answers, and other aggregate data) to analyze and track users’ use of the Site, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand online activity.

### **USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We compile aggregate de-identified statistical data and analysis for use internally, to share publicly, and to report project progress. We may also use your personal information in other ways with consent or as permitted by applicable law. By using the Site, you agree that we are hereby licensed to collect, use, share, and store anonymized (or pseudonymized) aggregated data collected through the Site for benchmarking, analytics, metrics, research, reporting, machine learning, and other business purposes.

We reserve the right to disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Goodbit, its affiliates, its customers, service providers, or the public.

We may share personal information with our affiliates or any business partners or agents acting on our behalf or with our financial, insurance, legal, accounting or other advisors that provide professional services to us.

Your personal information may be disclosed to a company or individual employed or engaged by us to perform functions on our behalf such as data processing or document retention. Any such disclosure of your personal information is made on a strictly confidential basis, and the information is to be used only for the purpose for which it was shared. We ensure that the company or individual adheres to this Privacy Policy. Subject to applicable regulations, we may disclose your personal information to a government agency, court, or law enforcement personnel.

### **SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.

### **CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES**

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. In our experience, many people are not familiar with DNT and have not set their browser settings accordingly. As a more universal privacy approach on our Site, we do not respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online; instead, we anonymize all data collected on this Site to ensure everyone is able to maintain their privacy.

### **PERSONAL INFORMATION USED BY THIRD PARTY WEBSITES**

From time to time, we may include links to third party websites which are not controlled or maintained by us. We are not responsible for personal information submitted by you to third party websites or the personal information collected by third party websites. You should review the privacy policies of third party websites or contact the third party website's operator if you have questions or concerns.

### **AGE RESTRICTION**

The Site is not intended for, or designed to, attract individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users under 16. Anyone under 16 should not use the Site.

### **YOUR ACCESS TO AND CONTROL OVER INFORMATION**

You may opt out of any future contact from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number given on our Site: see what data we have about you, if any; change/correct any data we have about you; request that we delete any data we have about you; express any concern you have about our use of your data.
